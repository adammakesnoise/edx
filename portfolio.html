Childhood: I remember as a child my mother insisting that I learn to type. She had been a secretary for years, and said that typing was a skill that everyone would need to have in the future. So she sat me down at our typewriter, and later at a computer using early versions of Mavis Beacon teaches typing. She also found a computer game similar to missile command where you would type words to shoot them down. (As an adult I hunted down a similar game, and Arcade Typing Tutor is fantastic.) I learned it because my mother insisted, but it was entirely hands on, and fun.

Young Adult: In college I was taking several jazz harmony courses, which focused on the mathematics behind creating the music. I was in a 210 level course, and had just skated by in level 201. At one point in the class I was very lost, and when the teacher - asked if everyone was good, I explained that I wasn't. I had felt that I missed something in the 201 course. Dan took a moment to use a few different analogies and examples to explain the practical use and the why behind the subject, and everything clicked into place for me. This was a required learning subject, but I was studying music because I wanted to, so it was a mixture of things I wanted to learn and other's I wouldn't have chosen myself.

Professional Development: I was in California studying how to provide one on one technical training to adults. In this course, the facilitator, an in-house corporate trainer, answered none of my questions and turned everyone back on me as another question. I became exceptionally frustrated with his use of the socratic method - even commenting on Socrates less than honorable demise. That frustration lead me to believe that I wouldn't find someone who'd be willing to give me answers, and I'd need to go out and find them myself. I was learning this to better support my job, which I loved. I couldn't see it at the time, but years later, my ability to find the answers I need is a strong suit, and I have a great love and respect for the efficacy of discovery-based learning.</div>
